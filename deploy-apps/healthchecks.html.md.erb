This topic describes how to configure health checks for your <%= vars.app_runtime_full %>
(<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) apps.


## <a id="about_health_checks"></a> Overview

An app health check is a monitoring process that continually checks the status of a running app.

Developers can configure a health check for an app using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface
(cf CLI) or by specifying the `health-check-http-endpoint` and `health-check-type` fields in an app
manifest.

To configure a health check using the cf CLI, see
[Configure Health Checks when Creating or Updating](#setting_health_checks_create_app) and
[Configure Health Checks for an Existing App](#setting_health_checks_existing_app) below. For more
information about using an app manifest to configure a health check, see
[health-check-http-endpoint](manifest.html#health-check-http-endpoint) and
[health-check-type](manifest.html#health-check-type) in _Deploying with App Manifests_.

App health checks function as part of the app lifecycle managed by Diego architecture. For more
information, see [Diego Components and Architecture](../../concepts/diego/diego-architecture.html).


## <a id="setting_health_checks"></a> Configure Health Checks when Creating or Updating

To configure a health check while creating or updating an app, run:

```
cf push APP-NAME -u HEALTH-CHECK-TYPE -t HEALTH-CHECK-TIMEOUT
```

Where:

* `APP-NAME` is the name of your app.

* `HEALTH-CHECK-TYPE` is the type of health check that you want to configure. Valid health check
types are `port`, `process`, and `http`. For more information, see [Health Check Types](#types) below.

* `HEALTH-CHECK-TIMEOUT` is the amount of time allowed to elapse between starting an app and the
first healthy response. For more information, see [Health Check Timeouts](#health_check_timeout) below.

For more information about the `cf push` command, see
[push](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/push.html) in the Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The health check configuration that you provide with
<code>cf push</code> overrides any configuration in the app manifest.</p>


## <a id="setting_health_checks_existing_app"></a> Configure Health Checks for an Existing App

To configure a health check for an existing app or to add a custom HTTP endpoint, run:

```
cf set-health-check APP-NAME HEALTH-CHECK-TYPE --endpoint CUSTOM-HTTP-ENDPOINT
```

Where:

* `APP-NAME` is the name of your app.

* `HEALTH-CHECK-TYPE` is the type of health check that you want to configure. Valid health check types are `port`, `process`, and `http`. For more information, see [Health Check Types](#types) below.

* `CUSTOM-HTTP-ENDPOINT` is the custom HTTP endpoint that you want to add to the health check. An
`http` health check defaults to using `/` as its endpoint unless you specify a custom endpoint. For
more information, see [Health Check HTTP Endpoints](#health_check_uri) below.

For more information about the `cf set-health-check` command, see
[set-health-check](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/set-health-check.html) in
the Cloud Foundry CLI Reference Guide.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> After you set the health check configuration of a deployed
app with the <code>cf set-health-check</code> command, you must restart the app for the change to
take effect.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can also change the health check invocation timeout for
an app. If you have installed cf CLI v6, use <code>cf v3-set-health-check</code>. If you have
installed cf CLI v7, use <code>cf set-health-check</code>. This option also requires restarting the
app. For more information, see <a href="https://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/v7/apps.html">Apps</a> in the Cloud Foundry CLI
Reference Guide.</p>

### <a id='healthcheck-lifecycle'></a> Health Check Lifecycle

The following table describes how app health checks work.

| Stage | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 1 | The app developer deploys an app to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. |
| 2 | When deploying the app, the developer specifies a health check type for the app and, optionally, a timeout. If the developer does not specify a health check type, then the monitoring process defaults to a `port` health check. |
| 3 | Cloud Controller stages, starts, and runs the app. |
| 4 | Based on the type specified for the app, Cloud Controller configures a health check that runs periodically for each app instance. |
| 5 | When Diego starts an app instance, the app health check runs every two seconds until a response indicates that the app instance is healthy or until the health check timeout elapses. The 2-second health check interval is not configurable. |
| 6 | When an app instance becomes healthy, its route is advertised, if applicable. Subsequent health checks are run every 30 seconds once the app becomes healthy. The 30-second health check interval is not configurable. |
| 7 | If a previously healthy app instance fails a health check, Diego considers that particular instance to be unhealthy. As a result, Diego stops and deletes the app instance, then reschedules a new app instance. This stoppage and deletion of the app instance is reported back to the Cloud Controller as a crash event. |
| 8 | When an app instance crashes, Diego immediately attempts to restart the app instance several times. After three failed restarts, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> waits 30 seconds before attempting another restart. The wait time doubles each restart until the ninth restart, and remains at that duration until the 200th restart. After the 200th restart, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> stops trying to restart the app instance. |

### <a id="types"></a> Health Check Types

The following table describes the types of health checks available for apps and recommended
circumstances in which to use them:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th style="width: 20%">Health Check Type</th>
    <th>Recommended Use Case</th>
    <th>Explanation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>http</code></td>
    <td>The app can provide an <code>HTTP 200</code> response.</td>
    <td>The <code>http</code> health check performs a GET request to the configured HTTP endpoint
    on the app's default port. When the health check receives an <code>HTTP 200</code> response,
    the app is declared healthy. <%= vars.company_name %> recommends that you use the
    <code>http</code> health check type whenever possible. A healthy HTTP response ensures that the
    web app is ready to serve HTTP requests. The configured endpoint must respond within one second
    to be considered healthy.<br><p class='note warning'><strong>Warning:</strong> To prevent false
    negatives, use a dedicated endpoint for health checks where response time and result do not
    depend on business logic.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>port</code></td>
    <td>The app can receive TCP connections, including HTTP web apps.</td>
    <td>A health check makes a TCP connection to the port or ports configured for the app. For apps
    with multiple ports, a health check monitors each port. If you do not specify a health
    check type for your app, then the monitoring process defaults to a <code>port</code> health
    check. The TCP connection must be established within one second to be considered healthy.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>process</code></td>
    <td>The app does not support TCP connections. An example of such an app is a worker.</td>
    <td>For a <code>process</code> health check, Diego ensures that any process declared for the
    app stays running. If the process exits, Diego stops and deletes the app instance.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### <a id="health_check_timeout"></a> Health Check Timeouts

The value configured for the health check timeout is the amount of time allowed to elapse between
starting an app and the first healthy response from the app. If the health check does not receive a
healthy response within the configured timeout, then the app is declared unhealthy.

<%= vars.app_healthcheck_timeout %>

### <a id="health_check_uri"></a> Health Check HTTP Endpoints

Only used by `http` type, the `--endpoint` flag of the `cf set-health-check` command specifies the
path portion of a URI that must be served by the app and return `HTTP 200` when the app is healthy.

This command only checks the health of the default port of the app.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For HTTP apps, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends setting the health check type to <code>http</code> instead of a simple port check.</p>
